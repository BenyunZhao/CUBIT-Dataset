Visual inspection of civil infrastructure, particularly building façades, has long been an essential yet
labor-intensive and high-risk task. Recent advances in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems and
deep learning–based defect segmentation have substantially improved the efficiency and safety of
visual inspection. However, despite significant progress in pixel-level defect localization, most existing
approaches remain limited to visual detection, providing only 2D appearance cues without the metric
or geometric information required for physical defect modeling. As a result, current segmentation
outputs cannot reliably quantify severity indicators—such as crack width, crack propagation, or
spalling volume—which fundamentally restricts their value for engineering assessment, maintenance
prioritization, and automated decision-making. This limitation is amplified by the scarcity of high-
quality datasets that not only offer pixel-level annotations but also support modeling defects in
a physically meaningful, scalable manner. To address these gaps, this study introduces CUBIT-
InSeg, a high-resolution UAV-based façade defect dataset designed to advance the field from pixel-
level segmentation toward physically grounded defect modeling. The dataset contains 6,996 high-
definition images captured from diverse real-world building scenarios using a customised high-
resolution UAV platform. CUBIT-InSeg focuses on two structurally critical defect types—cracks
and spalling—chosen for their prevalence and strong relevance to severity assessment under engi-
neering standards. Each image is annotated with precise instance-level masks to support geometric
reconstruction and quantitative measurement. We conduct extensive benchmark evaluations on more
than 18 state-of-the-art segmentation models, providing a comprehensive performance analysis and
establishing a strong baseline for subsequent modeling tasks. Furthermore, zero-shot deployments on
real-world building façades demonstrate the practical robustness and applicability of models trained
on CUBIT-InSeg. By bridging the gap between visual segmentation and physical defect modeling,
this work provides a foundational dataset and benchmark that pave the way for scalable, autonomous,
and quantitatively informed façade defect assessment.
1. Introduction
1
Civil infrastructure is vulnerable to damage caused by
2
a multitude of factors such as weather impacts, external
3
loads, structural deterioration, and poor design. Periodic
4
infrastructure inspections are crucial for remaining safe and
5
functional infrastructures. Currently, non-destructive testing
6
(NDT) devices like optical cameras [] [1], laser scanners
7
[2], impact echo [3], and ground-penetrating radar [4] are
8
used for manual defect detections in civil infrastructure.
9
Although human visual inspection is the most flexible and
10
feasible method for preliminary diagnosis, it is subjective,
11
time-consuming, laborious, and error-prone. It can also pose
12
significant health and safety risks to human inspectors, espe-
13
cially when inspecting high-rise buildings and large spaces.
14
To overcome these challenges, robotic platforms like un-
15
manned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground ve-
16
hicles (UGVs) [5,6] have been developed to achieve more
17
accurate and efficient infrastructure inspections, from data
18
collection and defect analysis. These unmanned platforms
19
integrating computer vision techniques help achieve better
20
inspection results.

In recent years, automatic image processing technologies
22
driven by deep learning methods [7–10] have achieved re-
23
markable breakthroughs, demonstrating substantial advan-
24
tages in both efficiency and effectiveness compared with tra-
25
ditional image processing techniques [11,12]. Among these,
26
instance segmentation—a task requiring pixel-level under-
27
standing—plays a pivotal role not only in achieving pre-
28
cise defect localization but also in enabling quantitative
29
defect analysis, thereby showcasing the superior capability
30
of deep learning in tackling complex visual challenges.
31
Consequently, an increasing number of researchers in the
32
architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) domain
33
[13,14] have shifted toward deep learning–based segmen-
34
tation approaches for the inspection and management of
35
infrastructure defects.
36
However, deep learning algorithms are notoriously data-
37
hungry, demanding large, high-quality, and domain-specific
38
datasets tailored to the characteristics of building defect
39
segmentation tasks. Most existing segmentation models are
40
trained on general-purpose open-source datasets such as MS
41
COCO [17], which feature abundant images, diverse object
42
categories, and complex scene compositions. In contrast,
43
the collection and pixel-level annotation of defect-related
44
images in civil infrastructure pose unique challenges due

to the complexity and dynamic nature of construction en-
46
vironments. As a result, there remains a significant scarcity
47
of well-curated, instance-level segmentation datasets specif-
48
ically designed for the building and infrastructure sector.
49
Despite the rapid progress of AI-driven visual inspection
50
for civil infrastructure, existing UAV- or camera-based ap-
51
proaches largely focus on detecting or segmenting surface-
52
level defects without providing the geometric or physical
53
attributes required for engineering-grade assessment. As
54
highlighted by recent studies, the community has reached
55
a turning point where defect modeling—rather than mere
56
defect detection—is becoming essential for structural health
57
monitoring [1]. Purely image-based recognition, even at
58
pixel-level precision, cannot convey crucial physical infor-
59
mation such as defect dimensions, depth, or volumetric loss,
60
which are fundamental for quantifying severity, prioritising
61
maintenance, and complying with engineering standards.
62
Consequently, systems relying solely on 2D visual cues
63
struggle to support downstream decision-making and can-
64
not provide inspectors with actionable parameters linked to
65
structural integrity or deterioration mechanisms.
66
To address this gap, a growing body of research has
67
begun exploring more sophisticated forms of defect mod-
68
eling. For instance, pixel-level reconstruction combined
69
with photogrammetric texture mapping has been used to
70
derive 3D crack representations [2]. Volumetric assess-
71
ment using depth-enhanced imaging further illustrates the
72
potential of geometric cues for evaluating damage extent
73
[3]. More recently, methods leveraging 3D point clouds
74
and dynamic graph convolutional networks have achieved
75
promising results in constructing as-inspected defect models
76
that capture both geometric structure and semantic attributes
77
[4]. Alongside these developments, advanced segmenta-
78
tion approaches—including SAM-based models [5] and
79
weakly supervised or scribble-annotation-based pipelines
80
[6]—demonstrate notable progress toward generalisable
81
and annotation-efficient defect understanding. Furthermore,
82
deep learning frameworks integrating appearance, texture,
83
and material characteristics show potential for more accurate
84
defect quality assessment [7].
85
However, a persistent limitation remains: most publicly
86
available datasets are exclusively image-based and lack the
87
physical metrics necessary for accurate defect modeling.
88
Whether designed for detection, segmentation, or instance-
89
level labeling, existing datasets typically provide only RGB
90
visual information without corresponding 3D geometry, cal-
91
ibrated physical scales, or standardized severity labels. This
92
absence of physically grounded information hampers real-
93
world deployment in several ways: (i) defect severity cannot
94
be quantified due to the absence of metric scale; (ii) algorith-
95
mic generalization is limited, particularly when transferring
96
from curated datasets to large-scale façade environments;
97
and (iii) autonomous UAV operation becomes difficult, as
98
the lack of metric cues impedes planning, standoff control,
99
and automated follow-up inspection.
100
These limitations underscore the urgent need for high-
101
resolution, physically meaningful, UAV-derived defect datasets 102
that support not only visual recognition but also the model-
103
ing, measurement, and interpretation of defects within the
104
context of engineering standards. This motivation directly
105
leads to the key contributions of our work: (i) a UAV-
106
acquired, high-resolution façade defect dataset that includes
107
both common and severe defects—not limited to cracks
108
but also covering spalling, which is emphasized in ISO-
109
based severity indicators; (ii) extensive benchmarks includ-
110
ing two cross-domain datasets to evaluate robustness and
111
transferability; and (iii) a quantitative zero-shot evaluation
112
on real-world scenes demonstrating the deployability of the
113
proposed system in autonomous inspection scenarios.
114
2. Related Work
115
With the rapid advance of UAV-based inspection plat-
116
forms and deep learning techniques, research in civil infras-
117
tructure monitoring has moved beyond basic defect detec-
118
tion toward a more ambitious goal: modeling defects in a
119
physically meaningful manner. While earlier systems mainly
120
focused on identifying cracks or spalling regions from im-
121
ages [8, 9], an increasing body of work now emphasises the
122
need to extract geometric, metric, and structural attributes of
123
defects rather than treating them solely as 2D visual patterns.
124
This shift is reflected in several recent research direc-
125
tions. One prominent line of work integrates multi-view
126
photogrammetry or depth-enhanced imaging to reconstruct
127
cracks or damaged areas in three-dimensional space, en-
128
abling volumetric or shape-based assessment [2, 3]. Sim-
129
ilarly, studies leveraging 3D point clouds and graph-based
130
semantic segmentation have demonstrated the feasibility of
131
building as-inspected defect models that encode both geom-
132
etry and material characteristics of concrete surfaces [4]. Be-
133
yond purely image-driven approaches, researchers have also
134
explored aligning UAV imagery with Building Information
135
Models (BIM) to achieve defect-level reconstruction within
136
semantically rich building geometry [10]. Recent develop-
137
ments further illustrate the integration of UAV sensing, AI,
138
and GeoBIM into high-precision digital twin frameworks
139
that directly embed defect information into geometric and

lifecycle management systems [11]. Collectively, these stud-
141
ies highlight a clear trajectory: the field is transitioning from
142
what a defect looks like to what it physically means for
143
structural safety and maintenance planning.
144
However, despite rapidly growing interest in defect mod-
145
eling, the majority of existing datasets remain limited to
146
image-only crack or spalling annotations—typically at the
147
bounding GT-Box or pixel level—without providing the
148
geometric, metric, or severity-related information necessary
149
for physically grounded modeling. As recent reviews point
150
out [1], the absence of datasets capable of supporting defect
151
geometry reconstruction or physical-scale estimation has
152
become a key barrier for the development and evaluation of
153
modeling-oriented algorithms. Moreover, the lack of high-
154
resolution UAV datasets capturing diverse façade defects
155
under real operational conditions further restricts the robust-
156
ness and generalization of such methods.

only UAV-based dataset in this group, containing 4,118 post-
169
earthquake highway images; however, it remains constrained
170
to roadway surfaces.
171
For building facade defects, publicly available datasets
172
are extremely limited. Crack-Seg [16] includes 4,029 images
173
covering pavements and partial building scenes, yet lacks
174
true aerial viewpoints and the high resolution required for
175
UAV inspection scenarios. UAV75 [17] provides UAV im-
176
agery but contains only 75 low-resolution samples, making
177
it unsuitable for training modern deep segmentation models.
178
Moreover, existing datasets overwhelmingly focus solely
179
on cracks and do not include more severe facade defects
180
such as spalling, which are critical for structural safety.
181
According to established building pathology standards1 and
182
professional inspection guidelines issued by the Hong Kong
183
Buildings Department2 and the Hong Kong Institute of Sur-
184
veyors, spalling of the concrete cover is classified as a high-
185
risk defect: it is commonly induced by prolonged moisture
186
exposure, oxidation of reinforcement, and the progressive
187
widening of pre-existing cracks, and may lead to detachment
188
of concrete or even localized collapse if left unattended.
189
Guided by these standards and by our prior defect taxonomy
190
studies, CUBIT-InSeg explicitly includes spalling—along
191
with cracks—to better reflect the defect types of greatest
192
concern in real-world facade safety assessment.
193
Another limitation observed across these datasets is their
194
generally low image resolution and low defect density: most
195
images contain only a single defect instance, which does not
196
reflect real-world UAV inspection conditions where multi-
197
ple, spatially distributed defects commonly appear within the
198
same facade view. Our CUBIT-InSeg addresses the afore-
199
mentioned limitations by providing high-resolution UAV
200
imagery, diverse defect types (crack and spalling), complex
201
multi-instance scenarios, and realistic aerial inspection per-
202
spectives, thereby offering a comprehensive and practically
203
relevant benchmark for building defect segmentation.
204
2.2. Path Planning for Data Collection
205
In this study, we develop an equal-distance UAV imaging
206
framework that enables high-quality data acquisition for
207
1British Standards Institution standards publication about "building
and constructed assets – service life planning" BS ISO 15686-7:2017

digital-twin-based façade defect modeling. The key objec-
208
tive is to ensure that each image is captured from a pre-
209
scribed, nearly constant standoff distance to the building
210
surface, so that pixel-level defect segmentation can be con-
211
sistently linked to physical dimensions (e.g., crack width,
212
spalling area and depth) in the reconstructed 3D model. Our
213
framework extends recent explore–then–exploit multi-UAV
214
coverage schemes for infrastructure inspection and recon-
215
struction [18, 19], and integrates them with depth-aware
216
surface modeling, equal-distance viewpoint generation, and
217
DT updating for defect-aware asset management.
218
We adopt an explore–then–exploit paradigm similar to
219
recent hierarchical multi-UAV frameworks for building in-
220
spection. During the exploration stage, each UAV performs
221
depth-visual SLAM to estimate its six-degree-of-freedom
222
pose and incrementally reconstruct a dense point cloud of
223
the façade and nearby obstacles. The environment is discre-
224
tised into a 3D occupancy grid, where each voxel stores (i)
225
occupancy probability, (ii) distance to the nearest obstacle,
226
and (iii) a reconstructability score.
227
The reconstructability is computed by combining stereo-
228
geometry and light-field principles: voxels that can be ob-
229
served from multiple viewpoints with favourable parallax
230
angles and sufficient field-of-view coverage receive higher
231
scores, while voxels that are too close to obstacles or outside
232
the effective sensing range are penalised. This results in a
233
density map 𝑅(𝐩) that reflects both the reconstructability of
234
the façade and safety margins around obstacles.
235
Let 𝑊
⊂ℝ3 denote the workspace, 𝐵the building
236
volume, and {𝐬𝑘} the set of surface points of the façade
237
estimated from the depth-based SLAM. The density map is
238
initialised using a coarse bounding box of 𝐵and is iteratively
239
updated as more points are observed.
240
To coordinate multiple UAVs, we employ a Voronoi-
241
based spatial deployment strategy inspired by distributed
242
coverage control. Let 𝑃(𝑡) = [𝐩1(𝑡), … , 𝐩𝑛(𝑡)] be the UAV
243
positions at time 𝑡. The workspace 𝑊is partitioned into
244
non-overlapping Voronoi cells 𝑉𝑖(𝑡) such that each UAV 𝑖
245
is responsible for coverage within its own cell. The density-
246
weighted coverage cost

--- Page 5 (CUBIT-Inseg.pdf) ---
is minimised by a gradient-descent control law that drives
248
the UAVs towards a centroidal Voronoi tessellation. This
249
yields a load-balanced spatial deployment where each UAV
250
converges to the “best” region of the façade in terms of
251
reconstructability and safety.
252
To guarantee collision avoidance, we follow the hyperplane-
253
based construction of safe convex corridors between UAVs
254
and obstacles. The Voronoi cells are intersected with these
255
corridors to ensure that the motion of each UAV remains
256
within a collision-free region while the global coverage cost
257
is reduced.
258
Once the exploration stage converges and a sufficiently
259
accurate façade surface model is obtained, we switch to the
260
exploitation stage to generate equal-distance viewpoints for
261
high-quality imaging and defect modeling. For each surface
262
point 𝐬𝑘with outward normal 𝐧𝑘, we define a desired camera
263
position
264
𝐯𝑘= 𝐬𝑘+ 𝑑target 𝐧𝑘,
(2)
where 𝑑target is the prescribed standoff distance, chosen
265
based on camera field-of-view, required ground-sample dis-
266
tance (GSD) for defect segmentation, and safety require-
267
ments.
268
To avoid redundancy, the façade is first discretised into
269
small patches (e.g., in the (𝑢, 𝑣) parameter space of the
270
surface), and one or several viewpoints are generated per
271
patch such that: (i) the angle between the viewing direction
272
and the surface normal is within a specified bound, (ii) the
273
overlap between neighbouring images exceeds a minimum
274
threshold, and (iii) the viewpoints lie within the collision-
275
free corridors and do not violate minimum distance-to-
276
obstacle constraints. This procedure yields a set of candidate
277
equal-distance viewpoints = {𝐯1, … , 𝐯𝑁𝑣} for each UAV.
278
After viewpoint generation, the viewpoints assigned to
279
each UAV are further partitioned into capacity-constrained
280
subregions by applying a capacity-constrained Voronoi tes-
281
sellation inside its working cell. The capacity of each sub-
282
region is defined in terms of (i) the number of viewpoints
283
and (ii) the estimated travel cost, which reflects the limited
284
endurance of each UAV.
285
For each subregion, we formulate a trajectory-based
286
travelling salesman problem (TSP): the edges between view-
287
points are weighted by collision-free path lengths obtained
288
with an A* or kinodynamic planner in the occupancy map.
289
Solving the TSP for each subregion yields a set of short,
290
feasible routes that visit all viewpoints while minimising
291
inspection time.
292
The resulting routes are then converted into an automatic
293
flight plan by exporting time-parameterised waypoints (po-
294
sition, yaw, and desired camera trigger events) in the format
295
required by the UAV autopilot (e.g., MAVLink mission file).
296
In this way, the proposed methodology extends existing
297
coverage-control algorithms from “high-level exploration”
298
to a fully integrated, DT-ready automatic route planner for
299
equal-distance façade imaging.

background bounding boxes.
2.3. Statistics and Target Position Distribution
301
Figure 3 presents the statistical summary and spatial
302
distribution of defect instances in the CUBIT-InSeg dataset.
303
Among the 6,996 images, a total of 62,187 annotated targets
304
are included, of which crack accounts for 51,865 instances
305
(83%) and spalling for 10,322 instances (17%), as shown
306
in Fig. 3(b). This imbalance highlights the natural rarity
307
of spalling in real infrastructure scenes. Although less fre-
308
quently observed, spalling represents a more severe façade
309
defect with higher safety risks, underscoring the need for
310
increased attention and dedicated data collection despite its
311
lower occurrence.
312
Beyond instance counts, the spatial distribution of tar-
313
gets is another critical factor in evaluating an instance seg-
314
mentation dataset. The placement of defects within images
315
influences a model’s spatial awareness, which represents its
316
ability to recognize objects across different locations, and
317
directly affects robustness to target offset or positional shifts.
318
In practical UAV inspection scenarios, defects often appear
319
sparsely and unpredictably across the façade. Models trained
320
on datasets with well-distributed targets are therefore more
321
capable of detecting defects located near image borders, in
322
corners, or in unconventional positions. Figure 3(a) visual-
323
izes the scatter plot of ground-truth bounding-box centers
324
for all defect instances. The distribution is reasonably uni-
325
form across the image plane, with a moderate concentration
326
near the central region: approximately 63% of all targets
327
(39,078 instances) fall within the normalized range [𝑥, 𝑦] ∈
328
{0.5±0.175}. Such a distribution ensures that models trained
329
on our CUBIT-InSeg dataset develop strong spatial gen-
330
eralization capabilities and exhibit higher robustness when
331
deployed in real-world UAV inspection scenarios.
332
2.4. Foreground and Background Box Sizes
333
To further characterize the geometric variability of
334
CUBIT-InSeg, Fig. 4(a) illustrates the size distribution of
335
ground-truth defect bounding boxes. The defects span an
336
exceptionally wide scale range: crack instances form thin,
337
elongated structures with short sides sometimes below 5
338
pixels, whereas spalling regions may exceed 4800 pixels
339
along their longer dimension. The strong concentration of
340
points near the lower boundary of the "Smaller side" axis
341
reflects the high anisotropy and extreme slenderness of
342
cracks, while the marginal histograms reveal a long-tailed

distribution covering both microscopic and very large facade
344
defects. This pronounced scale diversity poses a significant
345
challenge for both detection and segmentation.
346
Fig. 4(b) shows the distribution of background boxes,
347
which are randomly sampled non-defect patches used as a
348
reference for contrastive analysis. These background patches
349
are intentionally constrained to moderate sizes so that they
350
remain representative of local non-defect regions. The empty
351
region in the lower-left corner is expected: background
352
boxes smaller than 20 pixels on either side are excluded,
353
corresponding to the 20-pixel receptive field induced by
354
the 32× downsampling operation (P5-stage) in common
355
instance segmentation models (input size 640 / 32 = 20).
356
Patches below this scale do not constitute meaningful se-
357
mantic context for the model and are therefore omitted.
358
Compared with the highly heterogeneous foreground dis-
359
tribution, the background boxes exhibit a more compact
360
and uniform pattern, highlighting the intrinsic difficulty of
361
detecting tiny cracks that may occupy less than 0.01% of the
362
image while simultaneously handling large-scale structural
363
defects. Together, these characteristics underscore the geo-
364

2.5. Physically Based Defect Measurement from
367
Pixel-Level Segmentations
368
Given the equal-distance UAV imaging and automatic
369
flight planning strategy described in the previous subsec-
370
tion, all façade images in CUBIT-InSeg are captured at a
371
prescribed, nearly constant standoff distance 𝑑target from the
372
building surface. This imaging geometry enables pixel-level
373
defect segmentations to be directly converted into physically
374
meaningful measurements, which are later used for DT-
375
based defect quantification with the workflow in Fig. 5.
376
Let 𝐼𝑖denote the 𝑖-th UAV image captured at distance
377
𝑑target with camera focal length 𝑓and pixel pitch 𝛿𝑝(physical
378
size of one pixel on the sensor). Under the pinhole camera
379
model, the ground-sample distance (GSD) on the façade
380
plane can be approximated as
381
GSD =
𝑑target
𝑓
𝛿𝑝,
(3)
which, thanks to the equal-distance imaging strategy, is
382
assumed to be approximately constant across all images and
383
within each façade patch. Consequently, one pixel corre-
384
sponds to a fixed physical length GSD on the façade, and an
385
axis-aligned pixel square relates to a physical area of GSD2.
386
Using the instance-level segmentation model trained on
387
CUBIT-InSeg, each image 𝐼𝑖is associated with a set of
388
defect instances
389
𝑖= {Ω(𝑘)
𝑖}𝑁𝑖
𝑘=1,
where Ω(𝑘)
𝑖
⊂ℤ2 denotes the pixel set of the 𝑘-th defect
390
instance (either crack or spalling) in image 𝐼𝑖.
391
For crack-type instances, we first compute a skeletonised
392
representation to decouple crack length and width. Let Γ(𝑘)
𝑖
393
be the skeleton pixels of instance Ω(𝑘)
𝑖, extracted by a stan-
394
dard thinning algorithm, and let 𝐭(𝐩) be the unit tangent
395
direction along the skeleton at pixel 𝐩∈Γ(𝑘)
𝑖. The corre-
396
sponding normal direction is
397
𝐧⟂(𝐩) = 𝐑90◦𝐭(𝐩),
where 𝐑90◦rotates a 2D vector by 90◦.
398
Crack width. For each skeleton pixel 𝐩, we count the
399
number of consecutive crack pixels along 𝐧⟂(𝐩) that remain
400
inside Ω(𝑘)
𝑖:
401
𝑁⟂(𝐩) = |||{𝐪∈Ω(𝑘)
𝑖
∣𝐪lies on the normal line through 𝐩}|||.
The local physical crack width at 𝐩is then
402
𝑤(𝑘)
𝑖(𝐩) = 𝑁⟂(𝐩) GSD.
(4)
An instance-level crack width can be defined as the mean or
403
maximum of 𝑤(𝑘)
𝑖(𝐩) over all 𝐩∈Γ(𝑘)
𝑖, e.g.
404
̄𝑤(𝑘)
𝑖
=
1
|Γ(𝑘)
𝑖|
∑
𝐩∈Γ(𝑘)
𝑖
𝑤(𝑘)
𝑖(𝐩).
(5)
6

--- Page 7 (CUBIT-Inseg.pdf) ---
Crack length. Similarly, the crack length is obtained by
405
summing the physical distances between adjacent skeleton
406
pixels along Γ(𝑘)
𝑖. Let Γ(𝑘)
𝑖
= {𝐩1, … , 𝐩𝐿𝑘} be ordered along
407
the crack centreline; the physical length is approximated as
408
𝐿(𝑘)
𝑖
≈
𝐿𝑘−1
∑
𝑗=1
‖𝐩𝑗+1 −𝐩𝑗‖2 GSD.
(6)
For spalling-type instances, the primary geometric de-
409
scriptor at the image level is the defect area. Given an
410
instance mask Ω(𝑘)
𝑖
labelled as spalling, its area in pixels is
411
simply |Ω(𝑘)
𝑖|; the corresponding physical area is
412
𝐴(𝑘)
𝑖
= |Ω(𝑘)
𝑖| GSD2.
(7)
Additional shape descriptors, such as equivalent diam-
413
eter, aspect ratio, or compactness, can be derived from the
414
pixel mask and converted to physical units by scaling lengths
415
with GSD. These descriptors form a physically consistent
416
feature set for spalling, which is particularly important given
417
its higher severity in façade safety assessment compared
418
with cracks.
419
The above procedure yields, for each defect instance
420
Ω(𝑘)
𝑖, a collection of physically interpretable measurements,
421
e.g.,
422
(𝐿(𝑘)
𝑖, ̄𝑤(𝑘)
𝑖, 𝐴(𝑘)
𝑖, shape features, defect type),
all expressed in metric units under the equal-distance imag-
423
ing assumption. These image-level measurements are ag-
424
gregated at façade- or component-level (e.g., by grouping
425
instances within the same façade panel or elevation zone),
426
providing a compact statistical description of defect condi-
427
tions.
428
2.6. Physically Based Defect Quantification on the
429
Digital Twin
430
Building upon the physically measurable crack and
431
spalling descriptors derived from pixel-level segmentations,
432
this section integrates these measurements into a DT rep-
433
resentation of the façade. The goal is to transform 2D
434
image–based defect indicators into component-level con-
435
dition assessments that align with international building
436
pathology standards, including BS ISO 15686-7:2017 and
437
the inspection guidelines issued by the Hong Kong Buildings
438
Department and the Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors.
439
Let the façade DT be composed of 𝑀surface or BIM
440
elements {𝑗}𝑀
𝑗=1. Each defect instance detected in images
441
is associated with one or more façade elements based on its
442
image footprint and field-of-view projection.
443
For each defect instance 𝑘in image 𝐼𝑖, we have the set
444
of physical measurements:
445
Φ(𝑘)
𝑖
= {𝐿(𝑘)
𝑖, ̄𝑤(𝑘)
𝑖, 𝐴(𝑘)
𝑖, shape, type}.
We assign these measurements to façade element 𝑗if the
446
defect appears within the region of the façade that is imaged
447

flow: (a) defect registration; (b) defect assessment.
by the camera when capturing 𝐼𝑖. Let 𝑗denote the set of
448
all defect instances assigned to 𝑗.
449
The aggregated defect state of element 𝑗is represented
450
as
451
Φ(𝑗) =
⋃
𝑘∈𝑗
Φ(𝑘)
𝑖.
For practical analysis, we compute façade–element–level
452
statistics:
453
CrackLength(𝑗) =
∑
𝑘∈𝑗, type=𝐶
𝐿(𝑘)
𝑖,
(8)
MeanCrackWidth(𝑗) =

∑

̄𝑤(𝑘)

(9)
SpallingArea(𝑗) =
∑
𝑘∈𝑗, type=𝑆
𝐴(𝑘)
𝑖,
(10)
where 𝐶
𝑗and 𝑆
𝑗denote the crack and spalling instances,
454
respectively.
455
These metrics constitute the defect signature of each
456
façade component and serve as the input for severity grading
457
and maintenance prioritization.
458
According to BS ISO 15686-7:2017 [20], the Hong
459
Kong Buildings Department (BD) [21], and the Hong Kong
460
Institute of Surveyors (HKIS) [22], two defects are regarded
461
as highly safety-critical:

Immediate action / cordon-off
• Cracks: Risk of moisture ingress, reinforcement cor-
463
rosion, propagation into spalling.
464
• Spalling: Classified as a high-risk defect that may
465
lead to detachment of concrete cover and localized
466
collapse.
467
To align with these standards, we define a unified Sever-
468
ity Index (SI) for each façade element:
469
𝑆𝐼(𝑗) = 𝛼1𝑊𝐶(𝑗) + 𝛼2𝐿𝐶(𝑗) + 𝛽1𝐴𝑆(𝑗),
where:
470
- 𝑊𝐶(𝑗) = normalized mean crack width - 𝐿𝐶(𝑗) =
471
normalized total crack length - 𝐴𝑆(𝑗) = normalized total
472
spalling area - 𝛼1, 𝛼2, 𝛽1 = weights reflecting relative safety
473
impact (typically 𝛽1 > 𝛼1 > 𝛼2 due to the high risk of
474
spalling)
475
Normalization is performed with respect to ISO guide-
476
line thresholds and BD practice notes.
477
Using the Severity Index, we define four façade defect
478
levels consistent with ISO 15686 and Hong Kong inspection
479
practice.
480
These thresholds reflect:
481
• ISO 15686’s durability and condition-rating guidance
482
• Hong Kong BD’s classification of “defective concrete
483
cover”
484
• HKIS’s façade safety inspection criteria
485
The final DT representation stores the severity level, nu-
486
merical SI value, and detailed defect metrics for each façade
487
component. This enables automatic maintenance schedul-
488
ing, lifecycle cost estimation, and longitudinal tracking of
489
defect evolution within the DT environment.
490
Each façade element 𝑗in the DT is annotated with:
491
(𝑆𝐼(𝑗), Φ(𝑗), Severity Level),
allowing users to:
492
• visualize defect locations and severities on the DT
493
model;
494
• perform time–series monitoring as new UAV inspec-
495
tions are collected;
496
• support automated condition assessment reports;
497
• prioritize repairs based on quantitative risk levels.
498
This establishes a full pipeline from UAV image acqui-
499
sition and pixel-level segmentation to physically grounded
500
DT-based structural assessment.

3. Benchmark Experiments of the Proposed
502
CUBIT-InSeg Dataset
503
To comprehensively evaluate the proposed CUBIT-
504
InSeg dataset, we trained an extensive suite of deep learn-
505
ing models, encompassing 17 model families and more
506
than 80 individual networks, including convolution-based
507
architectures (Starnet [23], FasterNet [24], MobileNetV4 [25],
508
EMO [26], ConvNeXtV2 [27]), transformer-based architectures
509
(Swin-Transformer [28], CSwin-Transformer [29], RepViT [30],
510
EfficientViT [31]), and YOLO variants (YOLOv8 [32], YOLOv9
511
[33], YOLOv10 [34], YOLOv11 [35], YOLOv12 [36], YOLOv13 [37],
512
Mamba-YOLO [38], Hyper-YOLO [39]). These SOTA approaches
513
cover a wide spectrum of design paradigms and represent the
514
leading techniques in modern object detection and instance
515
segmentation. Leveraging such architectural diversity allows
516
us to establish a comprehensive benchmark while simulta-
517
neously validating the robustness and applicability of the
518
dataset across different defect inspection scenarios.
519
For evaluation metrics, we utilize mean Average Preci-
520
sion (mAP) by following the widely adopted MS COCO [40]
521
instance segmentation task, reporting bounding GT-Box
522
mAP0.5 and mAP0.5∶0.95 for objects localization, as well
523
as mask mAP0.5 and mAP0.5∶0.95 for objects segmentation
524
(detailed in Section 3.2). Adopting these widely accepted
525
metrics also aligns our dataset with common object-centric
526
benchmarks, thereby enhancing its comparability and gen-
527
eral applicability within the broader community.
528
3.1. Experimental Setup
529
All experiments—including both the benchmark evalu-
530
ation on the CUBIT-InSeg dataset and cross-domain vali-
531
dation on external datasets—are conducted on an Ubuntu

22.04 workstation equipped with an Intel i9-13900K CPU
533
and dual NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPUs. All models are trained
534
for 300 epochs with a batch size of 16, and no pre-trained
535
weights from any common object or defect-related datasets
536
(e.g. [40, 41]) are used. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
537
is adopted as the optimizer, and the detailed configurations
538
of optimization parameters and hyperparameters are summa-
539
rized in Table 3.
540
During inference, Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)
541
[42] is applied to remove redundant detections. For instance
542
segmentation, although the segmentation mask is ultimately
543
evaluated using mask-level IoU, the suppression process still
544
relies on the GT-Box IoU, consistent with the procedure
545
defined in Algorithm 1. Given an initial list of detected
546
bounding boxes 𝐵and their confidence scores 𝑆, NMS
547
iteratively selects the box with the highest confidence score,
548
denoted as 𝑀, and adds it to the final detection set 𝐷.
549
All remaining boxes 𝑏𝑖
∈
𝐵whose box IoU with 𝑀
550
exceeds the suppression threshold 𝑁𝑡are removed along
551
with their corresponding scores. Although mask-level IoU
552
is later used to compute mask-based evaluation metrics such
553
as Mask_AP0.5 and Mask_AP0.5∶0.95, the suppression step
554
remains box-based to ensure consistency and computational
555
efficiency. These mask-based metrics evaluate the quality of
556
the predicted segmentation masks by measuring their pixel-
557
level agreement with the ground-truth shapes, thus reflecting
558
the accuracy of instance-level defect delineation.
559
The IoU criterion evaluates the overlap ratio between a
560
predicted box / mask (P-Box / P-Mask) and the ground-truth
561
box / mask (GT-Box / GT-Mask). We adopt a confidence
562
threshold of 0.25 and an IoU threshold of 0.7, which follows
563
the setting of Ultratlytics framework. A visual illustration of
564
the IoU of computation is provided in Figure 6.

For benchmark training and testing our CUBIT-InSeg
566
dataset, it is split into training (5,596 images, 80%), vali-
567
dation (700 images, 10%), and test (700 images, 10%) sets
568
with resolution 640×640. Among the aforementioned SOTA
569
models, both convolution-based and transformer-based ar-
570
chitectures serve as powerful feature extraction backbones.
571
To ensure a fair comparison, we integrated all these back-
572
bones into the Ultralytics3, which is the framework used for
573
YOLO series and its variants, and adopted the same Ultra-
574
lytics neck and segmentation head, scaled using consistent
575
multipliers (n, s, m, l, x). This unified implementation elim-
576
inates architectural discrepancies and allows performance
577
differences to be attributed solely to the backbone design.

3.2. Evaluation Metrics
579
We evaluate all models using the standard COCO eval-
580
uation protocol, which is applicable to both object detection
581
and segmentation. For each predicted instance, the IoU
582
between the prediction and its corresponding ground truth is
583
computed—using bounding boxes for detection and pixel-
584
level masks for segmentation. Based on IoU, a prediction
585
is classified as a true positive (𝑇𝑃), false positive (𝐹𝑃), or
586
false negative (𝐹𝑁).
587
The fundamental metrics Precision (P) and Recall (R)
588
are defined as:
589
Precision =
𝑇𝑃
𝑇𝑃+ 𝐹𝑃,
Recall =
𝑇𝑃
𝑇𝑃+ 𝐹𝑁, (11)

To summarize performance across different recall levels,
592
we adopt the COCO-style Average Precision (AP), com-
593
puted by integrating the Precision–Recall curve. Following
594
the COCO protocol, AP is evaluated at IoU threshold 0.5
595
(AP0.5) and averaged across ten thresholds from 0.50 to 0.95
596
(AP0.5∶0.95).

We report both Box_mAP (based on box IoU) and
600
Mask_mAP (based on mask IoU). The box-based metrics
601
evaluate localization accuracy, while the mask-based metrics
602
assess pixel-level agreement and boundary fidelity—crucial
603
for infrastructure defect segmentation.

Figure 7: Comparison of six evaluation metrics at IoU thresh-
olds of 0.5 (a) and 0.5:0.95 (b) using radar plots. Dashed
curves correspond to End-to-End models, whereas solid curves
correspond to Single-stage Real-time models.
As the sample data showed in Fig. 2, the detection
611
and segmentation of the cracks are substantially more chal-
612
lenging than spallings: cracks typically appear thin, elon-
613
gated, and fragmented, with ambiguous boundaries, whereas
614
spalling regions are larger, more coherent, and visually well-
615
defined. And the significant disparity of the number of
616
targets is another factor (showed in Fig. 3). As illustrated in
617
Fig. 7, the Box and Mask AP of Spalling lie much closer
618
to the outer boundary of the radar plots compared with
619
those for Crack, which means that the performance gap
620
among models on spallings is relatively small, while cracks
